HTML
  - for indentation use 2 spaces NOT tab;
  - correct the formatting of HTML pasted from elsewhere
  - comment the source of code from elsewhere
  - indent within the head
  - do not add indentation for main or for div or similar block elements
// I know this last point is contentious but I really do not feel it improves document flow, because html is a text markup language, and indenting every line of a paragraph looks unnatural, squishes the text in the right of the screen, and is not possible for preformatted text.
  - Instead use a clear line before each of this kind of tag.
  - Indent the first line of each paragraph.
  - Indent elements within tables and lists apropriately.
  - Use xhtml5
  - use the new block level elements <header>, <nav>, <body>, <section>, <footer>, where apropriate, and in preference to <div>

//see html_example.txt for an idea of what I am currently thinking

JAVA

CSS
  - do not make changes to css sheets imported form frameworks (leave as is)
  - use custom.css to customise our look
  - no css styles within the html
  - indent using a tab
//I don't feel strongly about this we could use spaces, I just don't see any harm in tab for this

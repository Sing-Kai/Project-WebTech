<h1>Report</h1>

<p>By BL15686 and SC15316</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The theme and inspiration of this website came from the fact that both of us came from a scientific background, we decided upon a website that brings together accurate scientific news but also wanted to represent it in a artistic and creative light. The ultimate goal is to have a site where a community of users can submit and share articles, photography and videos relating to science. </p>

<h3>What have we learned:</h3>

<p>inkscape and gimp:</p>

<p> “NeuronWorld.svg” was created to be our main logo for the site. As this was going to be a logo svg seemed to be ideal, because scalability seemed important - the image needs to be flexible so it can be used in a wide range of settings, but always remain sharp, to present a good impression. </p>

<p>The idea was to convey the idea of the world connected through science, to do this we wanted a pattern of neurons connected around the globe. For the base of this image we used two images released under creative commons licences. An microscope image of neurons by <a href='https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neuron_011910.JPG'>Chempetitive</a> and an immage of the globe from freestockphotos <a href='www.freestockphotos.biz/stockphoto/16902'>www.freestockphotos.biz/stockphoto/16902</a>. The image of neurons was too complex to easily convert to an svg in inkscape; using a range of filters in gimp it was possible to reduce the number of colours, and enhance contrast (mainly using colourise and brightness-contrast). The amended image could then be converted to a vector graphic in inkscape. In combining the two base images in inkscape we used boolean operations, clipping, and conversion of bitmaps to paths. </p>

<p>In the process it also became apparent that although the filesize of svgs is not directly affected by the size of the image the size of the source files when automatically converting bitmaps to svgs does affect the filesize of the resulting image due to the level of detail. In the future I would shrink the source bitmap file before creating an svg, as I feel that this would make the file smaller with an acceptable loss of resolution.</p>

<p>CSS:</p>

<p>For implementing CSS and the overall style of website, we initially brainstormed ideas and drew the basic layout on paper and took inspiration from other websites that had a clean design. We were undecided for a period of time whether to create all of our css from scratch or to make use of a framework. We eventually decided upon using Bootstrap as the base framework to work with, this prevented us from reinventing the wheel, but also allowed us to learn details of CSS that we may not of thought of. We took specific features from the main <a href='http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/'>Bootstrap example page</a>, which allowed us to customize certain sections within our pages. One of the nice features we discovered was the ability to change background image of page via CSS. In our individualArticle.html, we have a background image that is generated from <a href='http://lorempixel.com'>this website</a> and is hidden away in our CSS file. This website generates random placeholder images upon refreshing. </p>

<p>Another feature learned by examining the files from the bootstrap framework was the use of media queries to create breakpoints and gain greater control over the responsiveness of the site. This is something I would make use of in the future, even if I decided to build the whole css template from scratch.</p>

<p>One of the downsides of using a framework was that there was a lot to take in initially. Once we had a basic understanding and how the grids worked it was quite easy to put together a basic style. However, there is still a lot to learn and as our understanding of Bootstrap and CSS deepens we hope to customize our site further. </p>
 
<p>Javascript:</p>

<p>Several of the templates we drew from when creating our site used Jquery to achieve their functionality, in particular for the image slideshow (script.js) and the drop down menu (navbar.js). Although we liked the effect achieved in these templates we felt that this would not give us as good a feel for the potential of Javascript as starting out with Javascript itself. For this reason we wrote scripts starting from the basics and thinking about what we needed to do to achieve the functionality we wanted, rather than copying a template. Although the drop-down menu only required a small amount of script, it meant digging down into the framework and finding out how exactly the css was working - learning new css tags in the process.</p>

<p>Where next:</p>

<p>Our first priority is to set up a method of updating and managing content more effectively, using a database to manage articles and images. This might also make it possible for us to implement page popularity features such as recording likes and/or views,  which could be used to determine where in the page particular articles are displayed. We are also looking at the feasibility of implementing a user login page and discussion threads.</p>

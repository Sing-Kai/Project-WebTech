Bees are crucial pollinators. They are under a number of threats. There is the lack of suitable habitats. Bees need a safe place to nest, and if they cannot find such a place the whole colony will die. In Britain most honey bees rely on man-made hives, but in other parts of the world they also make use of hollow trees and similar hollows. Without these it is almost impossible for them to survive in the wild. Varoa mites are a type of pest which weakens bees.

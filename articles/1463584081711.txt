I am a person who loves biodiversity. I keep a keen eye on all the bird-life which flies past my window, and the species which nest nearby. I often forget, however all the species of plants which make it possible for the animal species to thrive.

I think it is time we started to keep an eye out for all the plants around us, and start to remember the names of all our native trees, which so many of us have forgotten.

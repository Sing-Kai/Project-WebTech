Can cats communicate more effectively to there owners to express their needs? A study by Lund University in Sweden hopes to answer this question. Cats are known to vary their melody and sounds extensively. "We want to find out to what extent domestic cats are influenced by the language and dialect that humans use to speak to them, because it seems that cats use slightly different dialects in the sounds they produce."

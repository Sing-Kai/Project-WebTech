You might think that there couldn't be two less likely friends than a shrimp and a goby fish, however you could not be more wrong. The Tiger Snapping Shrimp is a wonderful burrow maker, but quite blind. In order to survive in the dangerous under-sea world it invites a goby to share its burrow. The goby can then keep watch for predators. This is a classic case of symbiosis.
